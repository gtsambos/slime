# slime

`slime` is a package for simulating admixed tree sequences with local ancestry information.

slime combines two existing tree sequence simulation softwares, *SLiM* and *msprime*. Admixed history is simulated forward-in-time with SLiM, while ancient history of the admixing populations is simulated backwards-in-time with msprime.


## Installation

Ensure you have `pip` installed and type this into your command line:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ slime
```

You will also need to install SLiM. Instructions are here:
